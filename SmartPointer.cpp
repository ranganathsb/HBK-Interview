/**
What are smart pointers? 
The answer is fairly simple; a smart pointer is a pointer which is smart. 
What does that mean? Actually, smart pointers are objects which behave like pointers but do more than a pointer. 
These objects are flexible as pointers and have the advantage of being an object 
(like constructor and destructors called automatically). 
A smart pointer is designed to handle the problems caused by using normal pointers (hence called smart).
*/
//Example about why we need smart pointer:

class Person  //person class
{
    int age;
    char* pName;

    public:
        Person(): pName(0),age(0) //constructor
        {
        }
        Person(char* pName, int age): pName(pName), age(age)  //constructor
        {
        }
        ~Person()  //destructor
        {
        }

        void Display()
        {
            printf("Name = %s Age = %d \n", pName, age);
        }
        void Shout()
        {
            printf("Ooooooooooooooooo",);
        } 
};

//client code to use person class
void main()
{
    Person* pPerson  = new Person("Scott", 25);
    pPerson->Display();
    delete pPerson; //every time we need to delete the pointer pPerson
}
/**Now look at this code, every time I create a pointer, 
I need to take care of deleting it. This is exactly what I want to avoid. 
I need some automatic mechanism which deletes the pointer. 
One thing which strikes to me is a destructor. But pointers do not have destructors, so what? 
Our smart pointer can have one. 
So we will create a class called SP which can hold a pointer to the Person class 
and will delete the pointer when its destructor is called.
*/
/**
Note the following things:

We have created an object of class SP which holds our Person class pointer. 
Since the destructor of the SP class will be called when this object goes out of scope, 
it will delete the Person class pointer (as its main responsibility); 
hence we donâ€™t have the pain of deleting the pointer.

One more thing of major importance is that we should be able to call the Display method 
using the SP class object the way we used to call using the Person class pointer, 
i.e., the class should behave exactly like a pointer.

Since the smart pointer should behave like a pointer, 
it should support the same interface as pointers do; 
i.e., they should support the following operations.

Dereferencing (operator *)
Indirection (operator ->)

So we need to override the above two operator to make the sp class like a real pointer
*/

//a smart pointer class only support class person
//The main responsibility of this class is to 
//hold a pointer to the Person class and then delete it when its destructor is called.
//It should also support the interface of the pointer

{
private:
    Person*    pData; // pointer to person class
public:
    SP(Person* pValue) : pData(pValue)
    {
    }

    {
        // delete pData in the destructor
        delete pData;
    }

    Person& operator* () //override operator* (dereference)
    {
        return *pData; //return the object pData point to
    }

    Person* operator-> () //override operator->
    {    
        return pData; //return the pointer pData itself
    }
};

void main()
{
    SP<PERSON> p(new Person("Scott", 25)); //need to specify type T as PERSON
    p->Display();
    // Dont need to delete Person pointer..
}

//Now the smart pointer class can support all types,
//but still have problem

{
    SP<PERSON> p(new Person("Scott", 25));
    p->Display();
    {
        SP<PERSON> q = p;

        // Destructor of Q will be called here..
    }
    p->Display();
}
/**
Look what happens here. p and q are referring to the same Person class pointer. 
Now when q goes out of scope, the destructor of q will be called which deletes the Person class pointer. 
Now we cannot call p->Display(); since p will be left with a dangling pointer and this call will fail. 
(Note that this problem would have existed even if we were using normal pointers instead of smart pointers.) 
We should not delete the Person class pointer unless no body is using it. How do we do that? 
Implementing a reference counting mechanism in our smart pointer class will solve this problem.

When we create a smart pointer p of type Person, the constructor of SP will be called,

The AddRef method of RC is called to increment the reference count to 1. 
Now SP q = p; will create a new smart pointer q using the copy constructor. 
Here the data will be copied and the reference will again be incremented to 2.
Now r = p; will call the assignment operator to assign the value of p to q. 
Here also we copy the data and increment the reference count, thus making the count 3. 
When r and q go out of scope, the destructors of the respective objects will be called. 
Here the reference count will be decremented, but data will not be deleted unless the reference count becomes zero. 
This happens only when the destructor of p is called. Hence our data will be deleted only when no body is referring to it.
